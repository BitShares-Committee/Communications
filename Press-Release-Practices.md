Press Release Practices for Major Approvals
============================

This is a recommended practice to be executed when major decision is made by the Committee to have news of the change communicated to the mass media via a well distributed press release.

Details
-------

Without coverage of the historical operations taking place within the Bitshares ecosystem the world at large are not aware of the blockchain advances we have operating for our stakeholders. It is in the best interest of all Bitshares holders for the Committee to be proactive in media outreach.

Solution
---------

BunkerChain Labs Inc. will arrange for professionally written Press Release along with mass media distribution for $600 bitUSD. $200 would be used towards the creation of the release, and $400 for its distribution to major distribution channels. All press releases would be reviewed and approved by the Committee prior to its distribution via github. 

The editor of the release will be the same editor who operated The Nullstreet Journal. 

Distribution includes news sites like MSNBC, ABCNews.com, LATimes.com, NYTimes.com, USA Today, MarketWatch, Yahoo Finance, Reuters, MarketWatch, and possibly Bloomberg. These along with over 100 reprints and hundreds of other distributions. These distributions are meant to reach beyond the crypto-only circles to the larger media. It will require an additional $99 if we want to include Coindesk.

Source of Funds
---------

It is recommended that the use of the fee pool funds be applied to this. Frequency of releases of this nature would be not more than once a month. It is recommended that $600 bitUSD of the current balance from the fee pool be reserved in order to facility this type of release following the completion of a successful fee proposal passing.
